# Hangman-Using-CSV-File-Java-
Basic program for a hangman game that uses a csv file for selecting a word. 
When a word is chosen, an array is created with length equal to the amount of letters inside the chosen word. The array is then populated with symbols and when the player successfully guesses a letter inside the chosen word, the symbols inside the array are replaced with the correct letters.
